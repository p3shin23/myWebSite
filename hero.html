<p> My mother Mimie is an amazing person, who is amazingly selfless, loving, caring, understanding, and compassionate towards everyone she meets. She tries to make everyone feel good, even if she doesn't feel good herself and cares for everybody who needs help. She works as a physical therapist for CHOMP, but she works at a small outpatient center called Westland House in Monterey. She works super hard for our family and tries to help everyone she can so she normally stays later after her work shift to assess her coworkers and patients. Since she's in the medical field, she works most of the week, many hours a day. When she is on her day offs, she's still working around the house, around the family, and still works hard, instead of relaxing.
    
    
<p> I chose my mom because she has been my biggest role model in my life and I didn't want to choose anybody else for this page than her.
